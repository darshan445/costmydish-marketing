          CostMyDish (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;) respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect,
          why we collect it, and your choices when using our mobile app and website.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not collect or store payment card details. Purchases are handled entirely by Apple App Store
          or Google Play through RevenueCat. We receive subscription status only.

          <li>Standard server logs from our hosting providers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and sync your recipes and ingredients across devices</li>
          <li>Authenticate your account and enforce subscription features</li>
          <li>Calculate costs and display margins within the app</li>
          <li>Improve reliability and fix bugs</li>
          <li>Respond to support requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>We use trusted providers to operate CostMyDish:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — authentication, database, and file storage (data encrypted in transit)</li>
          <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — subscription management linked to your App Store / Play account</li>
          <li><strong>Apple / Google</strong> — payment processing for subscriptions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each provider has its own privacy policy governing their handling of data.</p>

        <h2>4. Data retention & deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We retain your data while your account is active. You may delete your account from the app Settings
          screen, which permanently removes your recipes, ingredients, and profile data from our systems,
          subject to short backup retention periods.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use industry-standard measures including HTTPS, row-level security on database tables so users
          only access their own data, and secure authentication tokens. No method of transmission over the
          internet is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
